            <h1 class="h1">What I Learned</h1>
            <p class="para4">I gained knowledge about the Document Object Model (DOM), which is similar to the document structure. I discovered a new method for using JavaScript to create objects and to 
                In contrast to the previous method, this new approach to object creation was extremely clear and thorough. Regarding the destruction, it's highly
                perplexing to observe, but I am already familiar with destructuring. What's truly important is styling, especially when creating websites with CSS.

            <h1 class="h1">What I didn't Learned</h1>
            <p class="para4">Sometimes, i'm confused between the document.createElement and document.getElementById in DOM lessons. The template Literal is very
                confusing and hard to make beacause of the $ design and I don't know what's the purpose of the dollar sign. I forgot the difference 
                to declaring a variable between the var, let, const. I confused also about how to access object.
